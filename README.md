Matin:
- I added the calender
- it wasn't working with material theme so i commented out some line in angular.json
- i also changed the routing to display the calender module


-It's not good programming practice to add api keys and sensitive information to github that's why dotenv files are used
-please google "dotenv files"
-since angular is a bit different I have added a development configuration in angular.json which replaces environment.ts with environment.dev.ts which is added to gitignore
-for now we'll just keep it like that tho
